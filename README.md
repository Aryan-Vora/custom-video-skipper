# Custom Video Skipper

A Chrome extension that allows you to customize keyboard shortcuts and skip times for skipping forward and backward in any video. I'm not going to upload this to the chrome web store because there's probably an extension out there identical to this. 

## Installation

### Manual Installation
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder from this repository
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list and be ready to use

## Usage

1. Click on the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the settings popup
2. Set your preferred skip time in seconds (default: 15 seconds)
3. Choose your forward key (default: 'k')
4. Choose your backward key (default: 'j')
5. Click "Save" to apply your settings
6. Go to any website with videos and use your custom keys to skip forward/backward
